# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Added the class-first `GoobitsAuth` API.
- Made `GoobitsAuth` the package-root API and kept the lower-level `createAuth` engine internal.
- Added Node HTTP helpers through `@goobits/auth/node`.
- Added memory and PostgreSQL adapter bundles.
- Added security helpers, MFA utilities, and UI exports.
- Trimmed broad utility/security exports to the intentional public helpers.
- Updated the UI auth store to use generic auth endpoint names, generic request headers, and `{ user, session }` response data.
